# MaLiJAn

MaLiJAn is an implementation of the maximum likelihood analysis technique introduced in 
  [*Maximum Likelihood Analysis of Algorithms and Data Structures*](https://dx.doi.org/http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tcs.2009.09.025) 
by U. Laube and M.E. Nebel (2010).
It allows semi-automatic average case analyses of Java Bytecode programs with arbitrary, user-defined input distributions.
The generated results may be in terms of abstract cost measures such as the number of comparisons in sorting algorithms 
or the exact number of executed bytecode instructions.
A rich GUI and narrow code interfaces 
(method calls in the analyzed code define cost measures; users can implement their own input generators)
ensure a reasonable user experience for what is, in effect, a research prototype.
